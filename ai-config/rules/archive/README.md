# Archive: Twenty upstream rules

These are copies of Twenty’s upstream rules (code style, React, Nx, testing, etc.). They are **not** loaded by default. For Decibel we only use **rules/decibel-ai-architecture.mdc**.

Restore or copy individual files into **rules/** if you want that guidance (e.g. after a rebase you might copy updated rules from upstream Twenty). Otherwise follow the codebase and upstream.
